# ðŸ“– Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality.

* It is done if, when the values are strictly equal, the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged.

* It is done if, when the two values are equal but not strictly equal, the message "They are equal in value" is logged.

* It is done if, when the values are not equal or strictly equal, the message "The values are not equal" is logged.
