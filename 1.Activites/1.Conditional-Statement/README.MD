# 🏗️ Create an Algorithm Using Conditional Statements

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that takes in two expressions and evaluates whether both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the message "True ✅ True ✅" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are true.

* It is done when the message "True ✅ False ❌" is logged when `expression1` is true.

* It is done when the message "False ❌ True ✅" is logged when `expression2` is true.

* It is done when the message "False ❌ False ❌" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are false.
